# A repo for the code i submit on Codeforces

I recently got into competitive programming and i have been daily submitting code to codeforces.
I am by no means good at it yet, but i try to improve a little every day.

I decided to use C++ as it is popular for CP(competitive programming).

[My Primary Learning Resource](https://github.com/pllk/cphb) is the book "Competitive Programmer's Handbook" by Antti Laaksonen.
